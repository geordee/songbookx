Heir of salvation, purchase of God, 
            G  Em   D      A7     D
Born of His spirit, washed in His blood.

D                 G          D
This is my story, this is my song,
            G  D   E           A
Praising my Savior all the day long;
A7         D      G          D
This is my story, this is my song,
            Em     A           D
Praising my Savior all the day long.

D                   G       D
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
           A           E           A
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
D                 G           D
Angels descending bring from above,
             Em       A      D
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

D                   G         D
Perfect submission, all is at rest;
           A         E         A
I in my Savior am happy and blessed,
D                     G         D
Watching and waiting, looking above,
                    Em      A         D
Filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
