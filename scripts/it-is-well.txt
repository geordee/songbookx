     G             Em       C  D       G
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
     Em           C           D
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
    G       C              A2           D
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
       G           C    D      G
"It is well, it is well with my soul."


      C
It is well
D       G                  
With my soul
      C           D             G
It is well, it is well, with my soul.


       G            Em             C   D         G
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
    Em            C          D
Let this blest assurance control,
      G            C        A2          D
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
         G            C     D       G
And hath shed his own blood for my soul.



   G           Em            C   D       G
My sin, o, the bliss of this glorious thought!
   Em          C            D
My sin, not in part but the whole
   G             C            A2          D
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
       G                    C     D     G
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!


     G               Em          C  D           G
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
    Em               C           D
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
    G             C              A2           D
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
     G         C    D       G
Even so, it is well with my soul.
