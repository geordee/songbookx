D              Bm   G
Crown Him with many crowns
    D    G        A7
The Lamb upon His throne
     D       Bm       E      A
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
    A      Esus4    A
All music  but  its own
  D                 G
Awake, my soul, and sing
   E                A
Of Him who died for thee
    D        G      A7        D
And hail Him as thy matchless King
        G    A7   D
Through all eternity


D             Bm      G
Crown Him the Lord of life
       D      G        A7
Who triumphed oâ€™er the grave
    D       Bm      E      A
And rose victorious in the strife
    A        Esus4    A
For those He came  to save
       D           G
His glories now we sing
    E                A
Who died and rose on high
    D      G     A7      D
Who died eternal life to bring
    G          A7        D
And lives that death may die


D             Bm      G
Crown Him the Lord of peace
      D       G       A7
Whose power a scepter sways
     D       Bm         E        A
From pole to pole, that wars may cease
    A      Esus4        A
And all be prayer and praise
    D                   G
His reign shall know no end
    E                 A
And round His pierced feet
       D        G   A7    D
Fair flowers of paradise extend
         G       A7    D
Their fragrance ever sweet



D             Bm      G
Crown Him the Lord of love
  D        G         A7
Behold His hands and side
      D          Bm   E   A
Those wounds yet visible above
   A      Esus4 A
In beauty glori-fied
    D              G
All hail Redeemer, hail
    E                  A
For Thou hast died for me
    D          G     A7        D
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
       G   A7    D
Throughout eternity
