D          Bm       G          D
Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
A             Bm          G              A
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Bm           D           Bm        G
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
D         Bm            G        A  D
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word

I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord
Bm            D          Bm         G
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;
D          Bm            G      A    D
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

D        Bm            G           D
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
A           Bm        G       A
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Bm            D     Bm          G
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
D            Bm         G        A    D
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

D            Bm        G           D
High King of heaven, after vict'ry won,
A           Bm             G                 A
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Bm          D          Bm         G
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
D           Bm        G     A  D
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
