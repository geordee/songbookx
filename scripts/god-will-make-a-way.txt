D                A
God will make a way
            G               D
Where there seems to be no way
     G               D
He works in ways we cannot see
G               A       
He will make a way for me
D              A
He will be my guide
         G              D
Hold me closely to His side
      G                     D
With love and strength for each new day
G               A
He will make a way
G        A      D
He will make a way
      G              A
By a roadway in the wilderness
       D    
He'll lead me
     G             A             B
And rivers in the desert will I see
G                      A
Heaven and earth will fade
         D         F#m     G
But His word will still remain
    Em          A               B
And He will do something new today
