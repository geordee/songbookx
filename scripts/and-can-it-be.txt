                                
    G              C D7     G
And can it be that I should gain
   C   D7      G   D  A7     D
An interest in the Saviour’s blood?
                    G          D
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
    C       G      D7       G
For me, who Him to death pursued?
        D7               G
Amazing love! How can it be,
     C        G             D7      G
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
        D7               G
Amazing love! How can it be,
     C        G                 D7  G
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?


     G                 C   D7    G
’Tis mystery all!  Th’ immortal dies:
    C   D7      G   D       A7 D
Who can explore His strange design?
                      G      D
In vain the firstborn seraph tries,
   C         G        D7     G
To sound the depth of love divine.
           D7                G
’Tis mercy all!  Let earth adore,
    C        G      D7       G
Let angel minds inquire no more.
           D7                G
’Tis mercy all!  Let earth adore,
    C        G          D7   G
Let angel minds inquire no more.


    G                C      D7 G
He left His Father’s throne above,
   C  D7    G   D    A7  D
So free, so infinite His grace.
                    G      D
Emptied Himself of all but love,
    C        G      D7       G
And bled for Adam’s helpless race.
           D7               G
’Tis mercy all, immense and free;
     C    G       D7        G
For, O my God, it found out me!
           D7               G
’Tis mercy all, immense and free;
     C    G             D7  G
For, O my God, it found out me!


    G              C  D7  G
Long my imprison’d spirit lay,
     C  D7      G     D  A7    D
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
                     G          D
Thine eye diffused a quick’ning ray,
    C       G       D7          G
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
               D7                G
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
  C          G          D7       G
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
               D7                G
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
  C          G              D7   G
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.


   G            C   D7  G
No condemnation now I dread;
  C   D7       G  D    A7 D
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
                 G      D
Alive in Him, my living Head,
    C            G     D7      G
And clothed with righteousness divine.
           D7              G
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
    C         G              D7         G
And claim the crown, through Christ, my own.
           D7              G
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
    C         G                      D7 G
And claim the crown, through Christ, my own.
