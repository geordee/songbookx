C
Dashing through the snow
                    F
In a one horse open sleigh
                   G
O'er the fields we go
                 C
Laughing all the way
C
Bells on bob tails ring
       C7       F
Making spirits bright
F                 G
What fun it is to laugh and sing
                   C
A sleighing song tonight
G   C
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
G7              C
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     D7             G
In a one horse open sleigh
C
Jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
G7              C
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     G              C
In a one horse open sleigh
  C
A day or two ago,
                     F
I thought I'd take a ride
                    G
And soon Miss Fanny Bright,
                 C
Was seated by my side
C
The horse was lean and lank,
           C7         F
Misfortune seemed his lot
              G
We got into a drifted bank,
                   C
And then we got up-sot
G   C
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
G7              C
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     D7             G
In a one horse open sleigh
C
Jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
G7              C
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     G              C
In a one horse open sleigh
