E                          G#m
Over the mountains and the sea
                               F#m
You're river runs with love for me
                      B
And I will open up my heart 
                           E
And let the healer set me free
E                       G#m
I'm happy to be in the Truth
                         F#m
And I will daily lift my hands
F#m
For I will always sing of
B                        E
When your love came down
E                    B
I could sing of Your love forever
C#m                  A
I could sing of Your love forever
E                    B
I could sing of Your love forever
C#m                  A
I could sing of Your love forever
F#m              G#m
Oh, I feel like dancing
A                 B
It's foolishness I know
F#m                    G#m
But when the world has seen your Love
A                                   B      
They will dance for joy like we're dancing now
E                    B
I could sing of Your love forever
C#m                  A
I could sing of Your love forever
E                    B
I could sing of Your love forever
C#m                  A
I could sing of Your love forever
