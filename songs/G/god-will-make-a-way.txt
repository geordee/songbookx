[D]God will make a w[A]ay
Where there [G]seems to be no w[D]ay
He wo[G]rks in ways we c[D]annot see
[G]He will make a w[A]ay for me

[D]He will be my g[A]uide
Hold me c[G]losely to His s[D]ide
With l[G]ove and strength for e[D]ach new day
[G]He will make a w[A]ay
[G]He will m[A]ake a w[D]ay

By a r[G]oadway in the w[A]ilderness
He'll l[D]ead me
And r[G]ivers in the d[A]esert will I s[B]ee

[G]Heaven and earth will f[A]ade
But His w[D]ord will s[F#m]till rem[G]ain
And [Em]He will do s[A]omething new tod[B]ay
