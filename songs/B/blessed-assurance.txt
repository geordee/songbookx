Verse 1
[D]Blessed assurance, [G]Jesus is [D]mine!
O what a fore[A]taste of [E]glory di[A]vine!
[D]Heir of salvation, [G]purchase of [D]God,
Born of his Sp[Em]irit, was[A]hed in his [D]blood.

[D]This is my story, [G]this is my [D]song,
Praising my [G]Sav[D]ior [E]all the day [A]long;

Verse 2
[D]Perfect submission, [G]perfect [D]delight,
Visions of [A]rapture now [E]burst on my [A]sight;
[D]Angels descending [G]bring from a[D]bove,
Echoes of mer[Em]cy, whisp[A]ers of [D]love.

[D]Perfect submission, [G]all is at [D]rest;
I in my Sav[A]ior am hap[E]py and ble[A]ssed,
[D]Watching and waiting, [G]looking ab[D]ove,
Filled with his good[Em]ness, lo[A]st in his [D]love.
