Verse 1
Am[G]azing [G/B]Grace, how [C]sweet the [G]sound,
That [Em]saved a [Asus]wretch like [D7]me.
I [G]once was [G/B]lost, but [C]now am fo[G]und;
Was [Em]blind, but [G/D]now [D7]I [G]see.

‘Twas [G]grace that [G/B]taught my [C]heart to [G]fear,
And [Em]grace my [Asus]fears re[D7]lieved.
How [G]precious [G/B]did that [C]grace ap[G]pear
The [Em]hour I [G/D]first [D7]be - [G]lieved.

Through [G]many [G/B]dangers, [C]toils and [G]snares
I [Em]have al[Asus]ready [D7]come.
‘Tis [G]grace that [G/B]brought me [C]safe thus [G]far,
And [Em]grace will [G/D]lead [D7]me [G]home.

When [G]we’ve been [G/B]there ten [C]thousand [G]years,
Bright [Em]shining [Asus]as the [D7]sun,
We’ve [G]no less [G/B]days to [C]sing God’s pr[G]aise
Than [Em]when we [G/D]first [D7]be - [G]gun.
