[D]As the [A]deer panteth [Bm]for the [G]water
So my [G]soul longs [A7]after [D]you  [G] [A]
[D]You al[A]one are my [Bm]heart's de[G]sire
And I [G]long to [A]worship [D]You

{start_of_chorus}
[Bm]You alone are my [G]strength, my sh[D]ield
To [G]you alone will my [Em]spirit [F#]yield
[D]You al[A]one are my [Bm]hearts de[G]sire
And I [G]long to [A]worship [D]You
{end_of_chorus}

[D]I want [A]you more than [Bm]gold or [G]silver
Only [G]you can [A7]satis[D]fy  [G] [A]
[D]You al[A]one are the [Bm]real joy [G]giver
And the [G]apple [A]of my [D]eye

[D]You're my [A]friend and [Bm]you are my [G]brother
Even [G]though you [A7]are my [D]King  [G] [A]
[D]I love [A]you more than [Bm]any o[G]ther
So much [G]more than [A]any[D]thing
