Verse 1
And [G]can it be that [C]I [D7]should [G]gain
An [C]inte[D7]rest in [G]the [D]Sav[A7]iour’s [D]blood?
Died He for me, who [G]caused His [D]pain?
For [C]me, who [G]Him to [D7]death pur[G]sued?
Amazing [D7]love! How can it [G]be,
That [C]Thou, my [G]God, shouldst [D7]die for [G]me?
Amazing [D7]love! How can it [G]be,
That [C]Thou, my [G]God, shouldst die [D7]for [G]me?

Verse 2
’Tis [G]mystery all!  Th’ [C]immo[D7]rtal d[G]ies:
Who [C]can [D7]explore [G]His [D]strange [A7]des[D]ign?
In vain the firstborn [G]seraph [D]tries,
To [C]sound the [G]depth of [D7]love di[G]vine.
’Tis mercy [D7]all!  Let earth ad[G]ore,
Let [C]angel min[G]ds inqu[D7]ire no mo[G]re.
’Tis mercy [D7]all!  Let earth ad[G]ore,
Let [C]angel min[G]ds inquire [D7]no mo[G]re.

Verse 3
He l[G]eft His Father’s [C]throne [D7]abo[G]ve,
So [C]fre[D7]e, so [G]infi[D]nite [A7]His [D]grace.
Emptied Himself of a[G]ll but [D]love,
And [C]bled for [G]Adam’s [D7]helpless [G]race.
’Tis mercy [D7]all, immense and [G]free;
For, [C]O my [G]God, it [D7]found out [G]me!
’Tis mercy [D7]all, immense and [G]free;
For, [C]O my [G]God, it found [D7]out [G]me!

Verse 4
Long[G] my imprison’d [C]spi[D7]rit [G]lay,
Fast [C]bou[D7]nd in si[G]n and [D]nat[A7]ure’s [D]night;
Thine eye diffused a [G]quick’ning [D]ray,
I wo[C]ke, the [G]dungeon [D7]flamed with [G]light;
My chains fell [D7]off, my heart was [G]free,
I [C]rose, went [G]forth, and [D7]followed [G]Thee.
My chains fell [D7]off, my heart was [G]free,
I [C]rose, went [G]forth, and foll[D7]owed [G]Thee.

Verse 5
No [G]condemnation [C]now [D7]I dr[G]ead;
Je[C]sus,[D7] and all [G]in [D]Him, [A7]is [D]mine!
Alive in Him, my [G]living [D]Head,
And [C]clothed with [G]righte[D7]ousness [G]divine.
Bold I appr[D7]oach th’eternal [G]throne,
And [C]claim the [G]crown, through [D7]Christ, my [G]own.
Bold I appr[D7]oach th’eternal [G]throne,
And [C]claim the [G]crown, through Christ, [D7]my [G]own.
