{t:I Could Sing of Your Love Forever}

[D]Over the mountains and the [F#m]sea
You're river runs with love for[Em] me
And I will open up my [A]heart
And let the healer set me f[D]ree

[D]I'm happy to be in the T[F#m]ruth
And I will daily lift my [Em]hands
[Em]For I will always sing of
[A]When your love came down [D]

[D]I could sing of Your [A]love forever
[Bm]I could sing of Your [G]love forever
[D]I could sing of Your [A]love forever
[Bm]I could sing of Your [G]love forever

[Em]Oh, I feel like d[F#m]ancing
[G]It's foolishness I[A] know
[Em]But when the world has [F#m]seen your Love
[G]They will dance for joy like we're d[A]ancing now

[D]I could sing of Your [A]love forever
[Bm]I could sing of Your [G]love forever
[D]I could sing of Your [A]love forever
[Bm]I could sing of Your [G]love forever
