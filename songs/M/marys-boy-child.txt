Verse
[G]Long time ago in [C]Bethle[Am]hem,
So the [D]Holy Bible [G]says,
[G]Mary’s boychild, [C]Jesus [Am]Christ,
Was [G]born on [D]Christmas [G]Day.

Chorus
[G]Hark now! [C]Hear the [D]Angels [G]sing,
A [Em]King was [Am]born to[D]day,
And [G]man will live for[C]ever [Am]more
Be[G]cause of [D]Christmas [G]Day.

Verse
[G]While shepherds watch their [C]flocks by [Am]night,
They see a [D]bright new shining [G]star.
They hear a choir [C]sing a [Am]song,
The music [G]seemed to [D]come from a[G]far.

Verse
[G]Now Joseph and his [C]wife, [Am]Mary,
Came to [D]Bethlehem that [G]night.
[G]They found no place to [C]bear the [Am]child,
Not a [G]single [D]room was in [G]sight.

Verse
[G]Trumpets [C]sound and [D]Angels [G]sing,
[Em]Listen to [Am]what they [D]say,
[D]That [G]man will live for[C]ever [Am]more
Be[G]cause of [D]Christmas [G]Day.

Verse
[G]And then they found a [C]little [Am]nook,
In a [D]stable all for[G]lorn.
[G]And in a manger, [C]cold and [Am]dark,
Mary’s [G]little [D]boy was [G]born.
