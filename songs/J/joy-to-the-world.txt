{t:Joy to The World}
{st:Isaac Watts and George F. Handel}
{key:C}

[C]Joy to the world the [G7]Lord is [C]come
Let [F]earth [G7]receive her [C]King
[C]Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing and [G7]heaven and nature sing
And [C]heaven and heaven and [G7]nature [C]sing

Joy to the earth the [G7]Savior [C]reigns
Let [F]men their [G7]songs em[C]ploy
[C]While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy [G7]repeat the sounding joy
[C]Repeat repeat the [G7]sounding [C]joy

No more let sins [G7]and sorrows [C]grow
Nor [F]thorns [G7]infest the [C]ground
[C]He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found far [G7]as the curse is found
Far [C]as far as the [G7]curse is [C]found

He rules the world [G7]with truth and [C]grace
And [F]makes the [G7]nations [C]prove
[C]The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love and [G7]wonders of His love
And [C]wonders wonders [G7]of His [C]love
