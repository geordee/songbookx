{t:Jingle Bells}
{key:C}

[C]Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open [F]sleigh
O'er the fields we [G]go
Laughing all the [C]way
[C]Bells on bob tails ring
Making [C7]spirits b[F]right
[F]What fun it is to [G]laugh and sing
A sleighing song to[C]night

[G]Oh, [C]jingle bells, jingle bells
[C]Jingle all the way
[G7]Oh, what fun it [C]is to ride
In a [D7]one horse open [G]sleigh

[C]Jingle bells, jingle bells
[C]Jingle all the way
[G7]Oh, what fun it [C]is to ride
In a [G]one horse open [C]sleigh

A [C]day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a [F]ride
And soon Miss Fanny [G]Bright,
Was seated by my [C]side
[C]The horse was lean and lank,
Misfortune [C7]seemed his [F]lot
We got into a [G]drifted bank,
And then we got up-[C]sot

[G]Oh, [C]jingle bells, jingle bells
[C]Jingle all the way
[G7]Oh, what fun it [C]is to ride
In a [D7]one horse open [G]sleigh

[C]Jingle bells, jingle bells
[C]Jingle all the way
[G7]Oh, what fun it [C]is to ride
In a [G]one horse open [C]sleigh
